# Employee Productivity and Satisfaction HR Data 

My name is Harpreet Kaur. I am currently a data science fellow at the New York City Data Science Academy.

This project is about exploring HR data that dives into the dynamics of the workforce from personal demographics to performance metrics and job details. It helps organizations make data-driven decisions about their workforce. This leads to outcomes that can improve employee engagement and retention, optimizing performance, and effective turnover rates. On the other hand, it can be useful for Employees to gain insight for growth in compensation. Overall, accurate salary predictions are valuable for job seekers, employers, and policy makers as they help in making informed decisions about compensation, budgeting, and career planning.

I approached this dataset by analyzing factors affecting salary predictions and identify key insights to improve the accuracy of salary forecasting. Exploring different features, I started off by looking upon job titles that hold different salary ranges and dive into seeing the top ten percentile. Taking those outcomes, it led to further curiosity about employeesâ€™ productivity and satisfaction relationship and how it can impact salary growth. I also considered including personal demographics such as age and experience of employees to see how it can contribute to salary compensation. Considering the correlation results, it all came together to see which effective features are the driving forces for higher salary opportunities. Through this data analysis, I was also able to point out some lagging trends that management needs to take into consideration. However, more information is needed to explore those flagged cases.

The outcome from this data analysis can assist job seekers to understand the potential salary ranges and guide career decisions, negotiation strategies, and job selection. For employers, it can help in setting competitive salaries, planning budgets, and ensuring fairness in compensation. Lastly, it can benefit policy makers in assessing economic conditions, wage inequality, and designing effective labor policies.
